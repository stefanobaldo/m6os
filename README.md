# m6os

**m6** (pronounced "em-six", /ˌɛmˈsɪks/) is a Unix-like operating system for the
MSX, written from scratch in Z80 assembly. It is not a port: the kernel is
designed around the MSX hardware from the first line.

It brings processes, file descriptors, pipes and a composable shell to the MSX
while staying inside the ecosystem the machine already has: FAT12/16 volumes, the
storage drivers every Nextor-compatible cartridge already carries, UNAPI for
networking, and MSX-DOS 2 `.COM` programs running unchanged in an exclusive-mode
subsystem.

Said aloud, "m6" is "MSiX": MSX + Unix. The name also points at Sixth Edition
Unix, the small, readable Unix that left Bell Labs and seeded everything after it.

**Status:** work has not started. The repository holds the project's terms; the
first code arrives with the build tooling.
